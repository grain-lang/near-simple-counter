# Simple NEAR Smart Contract Example

This repository contains an example of a simple NEAR smart contract, written in Grain.

## Building the contract and running the tests

With Grain v0.4 and Node.js 14+ installed, run:

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

The `test` command will compile the contract and execute the tests defined in the `__tests__` directory.
